1. OVERVIEW

The check-db-links utility reads a DocBook XML file, locates all external links
and prints a list of those that are no longer functional to standard output. In
addition, it can be used to print all external links in the selected file
without checking their status, or configured to perform XInclude processing.


2. BASIC USAGE

2.1. Listing Broken Links

To list all broken links in a selected DocBook XML file, type the following
at a shell prompt:

    check-db-links FILE


2.2. Listing All Links

To list all links in a selected DocBook XML file along with their current
status (PASSED or FAILED), run the following command:

    check-db-links -a FILE

You can also list all links without checking their status. To do so, run the
check-db-links utility with the -l command-line option as follows:

    check-db-links -l FILE


2.3. Processing <xi:include> Statements

To list all broken links in a selected DocBook XML file and all files that
are included in it using the <xi:include> statement, run:

    check-db-links -i FILE


2.4. Getting Help

To print a complete list of available command-line options, run the
following command:

    check-db-links -h
